  <p>Breaking your devices is something that every device owner goes through at some point. Whether that means that you dropped it or you put too much weight/pressure on it. Maybe your phone's screen gets cracked or your computer is having some hardware failures. A broken device can be a slight annoyance at best and a serious problem at worst. Some people wonder if it’s ethical to know about your device’s parts and know how to fix them. There are mixed opinions on whether you should know or if you shouldn’t, but which is the ethically correct thing to do?

<h2>The Pros Of Knowing How To Repair Your Devices.</h2>
  <p>While there are a lot of pros and cons, we will begin by talking about the pros of repairing your own devices. One of the biggest pros with knowing how to repair your devices is that we would be lowering the amount of e-waste that happens around the world. According to Alana Semuels with TIME, there are about 6 million pounds of electronics processed monthly at recycling giant ERI’s Fresno plant. Some workers work on breaking down bigger devices while others work on getting dangerous parts out like lithium-ion batteries. Natasha Tusikov with the CIGI says that the problem is acute with manufacturers of electronic technologies since they use rare earth minerals. There is a movement called the Right To Repair movement. What their movement is about is that they want to protect people's right to repair. What they also want to do is to make repair more affordable and easily available to get critical parts for your devices. According to the Right To Repair movement website, Americans are spending close to $1,797 per household on new electronics every year. Another thing mentioned on the Right To Repair website is that when you can’t fix something yourself because they have restricted the parts, you end up paying more since manufacturer repair services are often way more expensive than if you were able to do it yourself. A problem with that is that if the manufacturer can’t repair your device then that means that you will have to buy a whole new device which is even more expensive. One other thing that the Right To Repair website says is that there are fewer choices when it comes to repairing your devices since they restrict access to parts and eliminate any competition in the market. While they’re restricting your access to their parts, manufacturers are blocking you from using third party parts, taking away your freedom to choose where and how to repair your devices. According to Maddie Stone with Grist, if bigger companies like Apple or Tesla released their parts, manuals, and diagnostic information needed for repair, it would make fixing devices easier and more affordable.

<h2>The Cons Of Knowing How To Repair Your Devices.</h2>
  <p>Just like with any argument ever, where there are pros there are cons. While there are groups that are trying to make it easier to repair your devices individually. The manufacturers are mostly all against it for multiple reasons. According to nerdstogo.com, the most basic argument against repairing your devices yourself is that in trying to fix it yourself, you could end up making the problem worse than it already is. The biggest problem with that is that you will most definitely end up paying more since you will either have to take it to an expert or you’ll have to buy a whole new device entirely. By doing either of those options, you end up spending more than you would’ve if you went to an expert in the first place. Another argument against repairing your devices yourself is that you don't have access to the right tools and the right parts. Snezana Vulgarakis on the repair depot says that since you’re trying to save money on the repair, you end up buying cheap repair kits and parts, possibly making your device worse. Unlike going to an expert who has the best tools and the right parts to safely and correctly repair your device. Another reason that Snezana Vulgarakis gives is that you don’t have the expertise to repair your broken device. Not having the expertise also goes with risking making the damage worse. It also gives another reason for why you should go to an expert since they have the expertise since they have made it their career to know how to repair devices.

<h2>So Is It Ethical To Know How To Repair Your Devices?</h2>
  <p>After researching whether it’s ethical to know how to repair your device or not, I have come to the conclusion that it is ethical to know how to repair your device. However I will say that just because it may be ethical, it doesn’t mean that you should try to repair your device. If you want to take the risk and like doing repairs then go right on ahead but if you don’t want to take that risk and you have the extra money to spend then you should probably go ahead and take your device to an expert. So my conclusion is if you can and want to then you can try to repair your device but if you want to play it safe then you should take it to an expert.
